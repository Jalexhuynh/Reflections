When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Perhaps so that way you could use the remote repository as a backup,
    to save your work onto an online server. Or to be able to use another
    computer aisde from your own, or work collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be times when you are not ready to pull or push changes.
    If you pushed too early, you might have incomplete code that gets sent.
    If you pulled too early, it might overwrite what you currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks 	- Make a copy of a foreign repository in your account, and allows
    		  for linking back to the original copy. 
    Clone 	- Makes a copy of a foreign repository, but now treats your clone
    		  as the original and thus the real origin cannot be found anymore.
    Branches- Are seperate version of the same repository, except perhaps
    		  a new feature or new set of code is being tested. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that way it can act as a backup when you need to compare merging a
    remote commit and a local commit that are both ahead of a prior commit.
