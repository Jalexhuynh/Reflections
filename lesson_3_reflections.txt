When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Perhaps so that way you could use the remote repository as a backup,
    to save your work onto an online server. Or to be able to use another
    computer aisde from your own, or work collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be times when you are not ready to pull or push changes.
    If you pushed too early, you might have incomplete code that gets sent.
    If you pulled too early, it might overwrite what you currently working on.
