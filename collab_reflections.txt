# TODO Brainstorm some ideas for collaborative project(s)

What are some things you want to build but seem too complex or overwhelming?

Which types of projects lend themselves to collaboration? Individual work?

What project might you pick that would specifically help you learn a skill
you have been wanting to pick up?

Find two examples of software you use or might use in web development that
are developed on GitHub (such as jQuery). Clone their repositories and explore
the project files in your favorite text editor (https://github.com/showcases/text-editors).
